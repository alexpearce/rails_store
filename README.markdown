Rails Store
===========

This is a simple store built with Ruby on Rails. The main purposes of this store are:

1. Very simple admin interface. The user-facing site also serves as the main back end.
2. Clean initial design.
3. Basic functionality should be solid, AJAX and other fancies are decoration and should not be critical.

Functionality is reasonably bare-bones for a store. Items can have one level of options, items and options have one image each.
The content other than items is pages, which are Markdown formatted. Eventually, PayPal will become the payment method for this
store.

I started making tests for this, but it's not my strong point. Hopefully this will change.

You should be able to push this to Heroku with no problems.
